0,517799941,ASYMMETRIC KEY MANAGEMENT IN CONSORTIUM BLOCKCHAIN NETWORKS,"Implementations of the present specification provide for management of service keys for consortium blockchain networks within a blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) platform. Implementations include actions of receiving a request for a service key from a participant in a consortium blockchain network provisioned within the BaaS platform, determining that the participant is authorized for the service key based on a service authorization table that records participant privileges within the consortium blockchain network, providing a key package including an encrypted private key of the service key, and a public key of the service key, and sending the key package to the participant, the participant decrypting the private key of the service key using a public key associated with the participant.",blockchain,2019
1,506396681,BLOCKCHAIN INCLUDING LINKED DIGITAL ASSETS,"A blockchain includes different digital assets, including digital tradeable tokens and inventory tokens. The blockchain may implement a transaction type that includes both digital tradeable tokens and the inventory tokens. The digital tradeable tokens and inventory tokens may be associated with physical assets that can be uniquely identified and are intended to be fungible with each other. The validation rules of the blockchain may rely upon quantities of the digital tradeable token and inventory tokens satisfying a predetermined relationship.",blockchain,2017
2,533331978,CONFIDENTIAL BLOCKCHAIN TRANSACTIONS,"A computer-implemented method includes: determining assets held by a remitter, the assets to be spent in a remittance transaction between the remitter and one or more payees, in which each asset corresponds to a respective asset identifier, a respective asset amount, and a respective asset commitment value; determining a remitter pseudo public key and a remitter pseudo private key; determining a cover party pseudo public key, in which the cover party pseudo public key is obtained based on asset commitment values of assets held by the cover party; and generating a linkable ring signature for the remittance transaction.",blockchain,2020
3,517799949,TRACKING AND VERIFYING AUTHENTICITY OF AN ASSET VIA A DISTRIBUTED LEDGER,"A system for verifying the authenticity of an asset is provided. The system generates asset authentication information that includes an asset print and an asset unique identifier. The system generates the asset print based on analysis of an image of the asset. The system generates an asset signature of the asset authentication information. The system then records the asset authentication information and asset signature in a blockchain. To verify the authenticity of a target asset, the system generates a target asset print by analyzing an image of the target asset. The system retrieves from the blockchain the record with asset authentication information with an asset unique identifier that matches the target asset unique identifier. The system then verifies the signature of the record and verifies that the target asset print matches the asset print of the authentication information. If verified, the system indicates that target asset is authentic.",blockchain,2018
4,535363623,GENERATION OF AN INDUSTRY TEMPLATE IN BLOCKCHAIN NETWORKS,"An example operation may include one or more of connecting, by a template generator node, to a blockchain that includes a plurality of user peers, retrieving, by the template generator node, a contract file from a ledger of the blockchain, executing, by the template generator node, chaincode to: extract a plurality of portions of the contract file based on a structure of a contract, determine common portions among the plurality of the portions, determine typical portions of the contract file from the common portions, generate a template based on the typical portions, format the template based on a state chart, and storing, by the template generator node, the template onto the ledger of the blockchain for access by the plurality of the user peers.",blockchain,2019
